# Hello

This is a minimal [OCaml] project that I use as a [template] for new
projects.

* Top-level Makefile for convenience: just say `make` but the actual
  build is managed by Dune
* Minimal command-line handling set up
* GitHub Actions CI ready
* Code is in Public Domain

# Changes

* This repository is a now a [GitHub] [template] repository: creating a
  new repositoty no longer brings along its history.
* I've changed the default branch to `main`.
